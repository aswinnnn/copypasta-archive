Tate Femboy

True story I saw Andrew Tate at a McDonalds and he no kidding was dressed aa a Femboy cat girl. He recognised that I recognised him, then hurried away so I followed him. I saw him get into a pink bugatti and start crying so I went over but when he saw me he just smiled and meowed. I was confused so I asked why he was dressed as a Femboy cat girl. He tried to pretend he wasn't Andrew Tate but I could tell it was him by his dimpled head. He finally confessed. He whipped out his wallet and offered me 15 dollars, for 'my hush hush'. He smiled encouragingly and raised his eyebrows in a seductive manner. 


I was flustered so I ran. I heard him shout hateful comments as i darted away. I didn't take the money so he made a series of YouTube shorts calling me a beta male who doesn't know how to grind. I still get hate male to this day.
