Is it normal to be attracted to a color?
I'm potentially bi, asexual, autosexual or straight. I'm also sexually attracted to the color white, whenever I see a young person (aged 15~29, regardless of gender) wearing white clothes and not too ugly I feel slightly aroused, and I sometimes masturbate to myself wearing white. (I'm sexually attracted to myself, in picture, in mirror or in person if I'm wearing white clothes) Also I masturbate to soccer matches, and whenever the white team scores, barely misses or concedes a goal I get quite aroused. I feel NO attraction to white objects like pieces of paper or walls though, but I DO feel a weak attraction to white clothes especially T shirts and shorts even when no one is wearing them.
Also, I might become sexually attracted to other people, male or female, if they're wearing other colors of clothes but white is a multiplier that multiplies my attraction to them by anywhere from 2 to 10. Is it a legit sexuality, a part of my sexuality, ir an abnormality?
