They Made IRL political

So I 36 M gamer decide to my leave mother's basement 73 F as I require my snackies my mom would go but, she says she's too old to leave the house but we all know she's a fat lazy bitch. So anaway as I leave the house I see this fucking woke shit in the sky like it looks like a pride flag or some shit I can't believe that the woke liberal agenda has made its way to nature so fucking annoying. I would just turn the nature settings off but this game doesn't work like that so I've decided to quit this shitty game by blowing my brains out with the shotgun that mom keeps in the shed.
