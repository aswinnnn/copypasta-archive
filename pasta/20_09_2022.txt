My wife (25F) refuses to eat breakfast unless I (27M) prepare it and call it fisherman's toast.

I know that this post seems completely ridiculous, and trust me when I say that I think the same. I'm at my wits end here.

My wife and I have been together for about 5 years. I'm a casual gamer (I play just a few hours a week) while she's much more invested. She dropped out of college, and when she's not working at her part-time job, she's playing video games. This usually doesn't bother me, as she often invites me to play with her. She's a good wife in every other way, and always manages to make time for me despite her gaming "addiction".

My wife is about 50 pounds underweight, and I'm sure this can at least partially be chalked up to her lack of a healthy diet. She rarely eats anything actually healthy, and while the two of us have tried to go on a diet together, she quit after about a month in, and lost again the five pounds that she gained within two weeks. She very rarely drinks water, and usually prefers soda or Redbull. Needless to say, she's really unhealthy.

Recently, one of her online friends mentioned something called "fisherman's toast", and my wife asked me to make it for her. All it consists of is bread and ketchup, and I assumed that she was just memeing, so I figured "why not". I made her the toast, and to my surprise, she actually ate it.

The next day, I tried to give her some actual meal, and she completely refused to eat it. I feel like I should at least be trying to get her to eat some hot meal, because it's incredibly unhealthy that she never eats any, but I think it's totally ridiculous that I have to do this for her. It seems childish, and while I chalked the first few times up to a joke, it's pretty clear that she's serious about this. She doesn't want normal food; she wants fisherman's toast.

So, Reddit; what do I do here? Do I keep giving in to her fisherman's toasts demands, or do I be honest about how insane this whole thing is? Help me!
