Imagine Anne Frank giving birth

 Just imagine her, sweating and panting, desperately trying to hold back crying out in pain. The hot tears running down her cheeks. Fighting a losing battle to keep her grip on reality as the hormones and receptors, overwhelmed by the pressure and burning sensations, cause her to lose all perception of time and surrounding. Being too sick and exhausted to even sit up, but still forced to continue enduring because she no longer has control over her own body. Feeling her pelvis split in two as she bears down hard and pushes with her rapidly diminishing strength. Having to content, not only with becoming a mother at such a young and tender age, plummeting self-esteem at the sight of her once slender body becoming the size of a planet, fear of being socially ostracized, but the unending terror of Nazi persecution of the Jews as well. That her agony-induced cries, no matter how muffled, will attract attention and be a death sentence for her and her entire family.
