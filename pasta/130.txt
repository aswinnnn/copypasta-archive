Response to "🤓"

 “🤓”? Are you fucking kidding me? I spent a decent portion of my life writing all of that and your response to me is “🤓”? Are you so mentally handicapped that the only thing you can comprehend is “🤓” are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with such a short response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was written was? Well, Will have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in fact, I even had my written work proofread by several professors of literature. Don't believe me? doubt you would, and your response to this will probably be “🤓" once again. Do I give a fuck? No, does it look like I give even the slightest fuck about one fucking emoji? I bet you took the time to type that emoji too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself for 20 hearty seconds before pressing "send. You’re so fucking pathetic. I'm honestly considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I'm simply far too nice to do something like that. You, however, will go out of your way to make a fool out of someone by responding to a well thought-out, intelligent, or humorous statement that probably took longer to write than you can last in bed with a chimpanzee. What do I have to say to you? Absolutely nothing, I couldn't be bothered to respond to such a Worthless attempt at a response. Do you want “🤓" on your gravestone?
