Tried to kiss my Yale interviewer at the end of our conversation. I massively fucked up.

 I (17 m) had my Yale interview today. The interviewer (25 f) was smoking  hot, and we really hit it off. She very clearly liked me and seemed to  be giving me “the look” left right and center. I honestly lost count of  the amount of times she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to  genuinely enjoy talking to me. We ended up chatting for nearly 3 hours,  and most of our conversation wasn’t even remotely about Yale—just random  things about ourselves. Towards the end of the interview, I had a  strange urge to go in for a kiss. It’s as though I completely forgot  that this was an interview for college, and my desires got the best of  me. I guess I completely misread the situation too, as she immediately  shouted “what are you doing?” as I was about to go in for it. I  instantly apologized and we kind of ended things awkwardly then and  there. I am really stressed out now about the repercussions of this; I  put a lot of work into my Yale application and it would really suck if  it gets fucked because of this. Am I screwed?
