I wish university had free prostitutes for the use of students (Found on r/confessions)

It's not fair. So many sexy girls. But can't fuck any. It should be considered torture to have so many sexy girls in short proximity and not being able to fuck a single one.

To fix this sexual frustration, university should hire prostitutes from within. Like think about it this way. The girl will get money from sex work, and the student's wellbeing will be better.

All students have to pay a wellbeing fee or some crap like that, but I don't give a fuck about doing anything in uni apart from getting my diploma and fucking girls. With the wellbeing money, the uni should hire prostitutes from within. Like offer girls out of high school a scholarship and a lower entry requirement in exchange for sex work.

Or better offer girls from poor country money and tuition in exchange for sex work. The students will get the exotic girls, and the girl will get education. Or even offer gilrs from richer asian country money and tuition in exchange for sex work. Fair for everyone.

I wish uni had free sex worker. Instead of other useless benefits like sports or crap like that.
