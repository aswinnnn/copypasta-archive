I miss grammar Nazis

I am not a native English speaker and on other forums, you could get torn apart for not using correct grammar and punctuation. But on Reddit? They are nearly extinct due to people mass downvoting them. I miss them because they were basically free English lessons. I made nearly 800+ comments here on Reddit and no one has bothered correcting my shitty grammar:((. Oh well, I guess I should just go back to improving my grammar through reading books.
