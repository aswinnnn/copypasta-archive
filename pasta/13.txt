AITA for listening to Snoop dogg's "Smoke weed everyday" in church?

So i was in church when the pastor said something and the word "snoop". That reminded me of popular rapper and celebrity Snoop dogg and his hit song "Smoke weed everyday", featuring Dr. Dre. I immediately pulled out my phone and plugged my wireless earbuds in my ears. But there wasn't any sound, so i cranked up the volume, but I still couldn't hear anything. I had no choice but to use maximum volume. Suddenly, i heard a loud "smoke weed everyday" from Snoop dogg. Everyone stood up and clapped, even the pastor. Then everyone began to smoke weed, but it turned out everyone was allergic to weed. They all breakdanced on the floor for hours. 
EDIT: Apparently now I'm a "cult leader" according to the court.
So reddit, AITA?
