have a serious femboy porn issue (from r/offmychest)

I have a serious femboy porn issue.

Ok, I know this sounds like a meme but I swear it's not. For the past week or so I've been basically addicted to femboy porn. Like I've used it to get off a solid 3-4 times this week. I consider myself 100% straight. I have a loving girlfriend, and I love her with all my heart too, and I know it would break her heart knowing I've been jacking off to femboys and not her. I feel terrible about this and I really want to stop this.
