Found this as the only comment on someone's Steam profile. We thought it was a copypasta, it isn't but it is now.

I dont mean to be disrespectful, im just curious. Lets say u r very in love with ur waifu/husbando and u get on a phone call with someone who sounds exactly like them and is roleplaying. do you allow yourself to indulge and pretend thats really them? or would it feel too much like cheating?
