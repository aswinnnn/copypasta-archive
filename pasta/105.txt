Is 2042 worth buying?

Hey guys I am homeless and have $7.52 to my name but I saw BF2042 on sale for $58.99 in my local GameStop (I sleep behind there) and I’m sure I can borrow some money from my buddy Slick Rick. I heard that the new updates make it really playable so should I get it? I’m thinking I could hook it up to the CC TV at my local police department or possible steal a television and GameStationBoy 3. 

The last game I played was Tetris so I’m looking to upgrade. 

Thanks
