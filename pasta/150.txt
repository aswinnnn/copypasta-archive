If youre not basically fingering your asshole when you wipe, you need help

Obligatory fuck off eurocucks, no one cares about your homoerotic bidets

Anyway, I used to just wipe the outside. My ass would always be itchy. Then I read this wikihow article that said you shouldnt be afraid to stick your finger in your ass when youre wiping to get it good. So i started doing that. Basically I finger my asshole a bunch when I wipe. You clean on the inside a bunch until theres nothing on the paper. Shit is based, never been itchy since

If youre not doing this, seek jesus. And again, fuck off eurogays.
