Please do not say "lmao."

Please do not say “lmao.” It is not a very nice “word” { more like a made up word lol sorry } because it is saying the A word which is a curse word. Saying the A word is wrong and does not please the one true and Living God which is our Lord Jesus Christ who shed His precious blood  FOR humanity / mankind [ on the cross ] and we very truly need to respect that because, like bro, He died on the cross for humanity / mankind. Amen. 🤠🤠🥺🥺😉😉
