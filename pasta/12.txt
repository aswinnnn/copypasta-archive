Pronouns In War

Please consider pronouns before going to war

Remember that, in the fog of war, people will likely refer to you by the gender assigned to you at birth.

So make sure you wear a badge with your preferred pronouns so that you don't suffer unnecessary verbal violence
and bigotry in the field.

The last thing you want to hear is someone mis-gendering you as you bleed out after a fire fight.

Expect to encounter a lot of heteronormative language - typical of the chauvinist environment in which you will find yourself. 

Shouts like "watch out, lads", "listen in, boys" and other micro-aggressions will wear you down as the white
male dominated armed forces attempt to erase your lived experience.

If you can, be the change you want to see.
You can do this by shouting "Zhere coming from the south!", or "two possible BIPOC folx taking cover at your 6!".

People will respect your efforts to be inclusive in the theatre of war.

Ultimately, silence is violence, and you'll be wanting as little additional violence as possible.
