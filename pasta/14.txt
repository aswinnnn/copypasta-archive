guide on how to fuck a pigeon

Like any woman, a pigeon needs to be in a relaxed and receptive mood before you can successfully have sex with it. If you do not make sure of this, you will end up covered in scratches and peck marks in locations that will be hard to explain. Gently pick the pigeon up in both hands and stroke it slowly, so that it becomes accustomed to sitting in your hand. Making soft clucking noises is also a good seduction tip. Get your penis nice and lubricated, and place the head at the entry of the pigeon butt. I'm calling it a butt, but it acts as a vagina, an anus, and a urethra all in one (actually, pigeon only have one form of elimination). You need to be erect when you do this, because otherwise, it will be hard to enter your new girlfriend. Slowly push your penis inside the pigeon. You should have one hand on the neck of the bird, just below the head, so that it cannot peck you. The other hand may need to hold the feet to prevent scratching. Try to keep the bird as calm as you can as you do this. If a pigeon butt can accommodate an egg, it can expand to fit your dick, albeit somewhat tightly. However, the butt is not all that deep, and you will hit bottom fairly quickly. Don't try and push the limits here, just be glad that you're getting some.
