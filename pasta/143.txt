Shaving guide for men ~ from a femboy :) [OC]

*Update: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SO MANY LINK SHARES🥹❤️Crossed 300 reshares! And SOOO many upvotes too🥺 maybe I should create some more guides☺️Let me know what you want me to :)*

I'm a Femboy here so...some of this may be extreme but you can look into the particular heading :) I've been shaving my body from last 4-5 years. I'll mention what I follow.

In my opinion, nothing makes a man more sexy, hot and attractive than him sporting an all natural bush🌳😊! 

But since hygiene may be compromised at times, I feel this can help a lot of the jocks, studs, hunks, dads and men in general on this sub-reddit :'P! And since many of you might feel shy regarding this, I thought of sharing my insights, experience and the way I go for shaving the pubes 😊:-

(Do all this with **warm water.** Cold water would tighten your pores and won't give the comfortable finish)

**Starting with a trimmer** with a clip-on to avoid any skin coming between the trimmer, **set it on around 3-4 scale and cut all long and thick hair possible!** This will help in a faster shave later and may not clog your razor blade! 🪒

**For dicky 🍆:** Get yourself **slightly erected (semi)**! The reason, so that you can get a tighter skin to work on the base of your manhood which will lead to easier and quicker shaving :)! Work your way up near the pubic region first by foaming with shaving cream/gel and lathering 🧼😄 then slowly reach up the shaft and go along the grain. Once you're finished doing this, rinse the area thoroughly!

---------------------------------

**For balls 🍒:** You don't necessarily need to be hard or semi. But you have to make sure that you lather and foam much better and gently! And absolutely **NO USE OF ELECTRIC TRIMMER!** This would be your worst choice and no matter how much clippers you use, your skin on your balls can 90% be snipped between them! Always prefer shaving or at max, using a scissor to gently trim the hair. Then **take smaller segments of the skin on your testicles and gently stretch it and then run the razor to make that area smooth** 🪒😄and then finish off the remaining! And be very gently and calm! My advice would be to go for a **warm shower** rather than a cold one so that your balls are relaxed, loose and hang instead of a tight skin! 

Keep rinsing and applying the cream again and again as you will have to see how much is left 😄! Apply an aftershave once you're done with this to prevent any infections in the area :)

---------------------------------

**LEGS 🦵🏻 -** 
Firstly, trim your hair using a electric body trimmer for a faster and easier shaving process. Rinse the hair and apply the shaving gel and create lather. Let it sit on for 30s to make the skin soft and hydrated. **DO NOT go against the grain on your thighs** ! I have done this in the past and it gives so much bumps and itchyness. Follow your natural hair growth and shave in that. Below the knees, you can go against the grain by just sliding the razor from up to down at first then down to up. 

---------------------------------

**BUTTOCKS 🍑 -** 
I don't like to use a trimmer to cut any excess hair as the skin over there might get agitated and create bumps later. Shaving procedure remains the same. The way I do it is I **stand in front of mirror and then shave by my instinct and then twist to see if everything's clear** (sounds funny lol because it is🥲😂).

                               ---------------------------------

**NEAR THE HOLE 🍩-**
Very sensitive area and you have to go much slowly and not overdo or repeat the strokes. **For this, I usually do this after I finish my shower, I lie on my back and then spread my legs (like missionary position) and get a clear look of the centre and then watch in the mirror as I shave**. Again, a bit hard to do but works well after some practice :)

                               ---------------------------------

**CHEST AND BELLY🤰🏻 -**
Use a trimmer on dry skin and trim all your hair well and good till the base. I sometimes prefer this as it gets the job done of smoothening. But if opting for shaving, the process remains the same. But *you may get an itch or redness for 2-3 days after you shave* against the grain. **DON'T** itch it a lot or else it will worsen the skin.


**Always moisturize after shaving** the avoid itching, rashes and irritation due to dry skin after!

---------------------------------

**Incase you're someone who fancy a beautiful pubic shape**, you can first **set your trimmer to a 4-5 scale and then trim off all the longer bush and then remove the clip-ons and trim it from the base to your desires shape** :) this *needs to be done prior to shaving the area hence, on a dry skin!* Then repeat the procedure for shaving until you end up with the clean, neat and well shaped pubic artwork 😄🪴!

----------------------------------

**Optional pro-tip** : Your feet are as cute as your body :'D so make sure you prep the toes, nails and soles well. The same moisturiser works! But if you want the **skin to remain soft and supple, grab an ice cube 🧊 and slowly rub it before sleeping to increase circulation and make them pink and soft naturally! The same can be done for your face if you're suffering from acne!** *It works wonders for real* 🦶🏻🧏🏻‍♂️

                             ---------------------------------        

**Clean/change your bedsheet that particular day** as your bedsheet may have dirt or bacteria which might irritate or cause skin to get infected due to open pores after shaving.

                             ---------------------------------

**GOT A CUT WHILE SHAVING🥺😱!?!**
No need to panic at all :) We've all been there! I've cut myself a few times and it's mostly either because I wasn't lathered and relaxed the skin enough or it was an area where I am not able to see clearly hence, my instincts go wrong :/ In such a case, **immediately stop shaving that area and just sit or have that area rinsed in cold shower. If you're bleeding, keep washing with cold water until bleeding stops. Finish your shower and gently apply an antiseptic in a cotton ball (ouch😣but it's going to save you😄)! And throw that particular blade and get a new one!** After that, make sure atleast for a day not to irritate or rub the area by anything! Small cuts heal in a day )

                              ---------------------------------

Get yourself nice and cleansed in the shower but my recommendation would be **not use any bodywash or soap the same day** as these consists of chemicals which may cause irritation to the shaved area. So, I just **use a loofah sponge** and gently, under the warm shower, start swirling it around in circulation motion all over my body. This is called **exfoliation and is important to avoid bumpyness and dry dead skin left on the body** :) it *really* works!

                              ---------------------------------

After the shower, **use a moisturizer with less fragrance and no parabens** preferably (I use **Calosoft and Hymos lotion** as suggested by my dermat). Drop **2-3 drops of Tea Tree Essential Oil** in your moisturiser to avoid any acne/buttne on your skin :) (this can be optional as tea tree oil might be strong for some skin)

                              ---------------------------------

Hope this helps to you all❤️☺️ Any suggestions or questions from other people are most welcome in the comments :'D!
