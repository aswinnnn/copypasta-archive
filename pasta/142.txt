Examination of my femboys ass with a flashlight

Examiner notes: It is 10:09 AM EST and pre-examination procedures are being conducted. The specimen has rinsed its rectum with a sanitizing agent in preparation for the procedure. Upon insertion of the distal phalange with sterile medical examination gloves, the specimen’s mucosa were substantially hemorrhaged from prior penetration by the examiner. Upon insertion of the middle phalange, it was noted that the specimen’s transitional zone was inflamed. Redness and swelling were observed. During insertion of the proximal phalange, the specimen performed thrusting motions and verbally communicated indications of pleasure. The specimen’s sphincter muscles were tender. Upon contact between the examiner’s distal phalange and the specimen’s prostate gland, the specimen began to experience convulsions. Upon penile penetration, the examiner noted immense friction and premature ejaculation into the specimen’s rectum. 

Findings: Despite subsequent minor injuries from prior penetration by the examiner, both the examiner and the specimen indicated pleasure. It is noted that the specimen does not require resting intervals between penile penetrative activity.
