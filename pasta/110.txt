Advice on picking up a minor?

hey guys, I’m a 20 year old male college student and I’ve really been thinking about getting a minor. There’s a background check and I’m not sure if it’s worth the effort or if I should I should just get one from a local community college instead (I heard minors are easier to get there). For anyone who’s picked up a minor before, did it benefit your life/career in any way or did you do it just to kill time?

Edit: just to clarify, I mean declaring my intent to get a minor with my degree

Edit2: why do people think I’m talking about children
