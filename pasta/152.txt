Hello, tarkov community.

I am seeking help for my 14 year old son James who recently got into the game. I didnt think much of it at first but now he has begun acting really weird whenever we are at the dinner table or when the game is down. He refers to his room (in which he plays tarkov) as a "hideout" and whenever i try to cook something for him (he loves fried eggs so i usually make those) he starts SCREAMING and demands "tushonka" and "rye crouton." He also refers to his chemistry teacher, Mr. Smith as "prapor" and im starting to get worried that he may upset others with his strange behaviour. He also never leaves his room unless i call him downstairs to eat. He has begun "looting" all of the chocolate and sugar around the house and hiding it in his "stash" (he refers to a big box in his room as his "stash") and when i try to ask for it back he gets really upset and calls me a "dirty rat" and tells me to "vog17 myself." please help!
