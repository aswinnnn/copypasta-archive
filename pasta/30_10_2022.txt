My girlfriend's feline fetish

Last week my girlfriend revealed that she had a cat fetish or something like that. But I didn't want to judge her, hey, we all have our kinks. So I decided to go with the flow.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday we were in our bed. I was scrolling r/combatfootage and she was meditating. As I watch grenades fall into a russian foxhole I feel my dick being squeezed.

&amp;#x200B;

I look and see her hand petting my growing member. She's smiling at me. I notice she has cat ears and I remember what she said last week. I give her a smirk and shut my phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I pull my pants off and make a crap joke: "I know what's doggystyle, but what's cat-"

&amp;#x200B;

She interrupts me mid-sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

"No. I don't want sex, I just want you to be my owner. Meow."

&amp;#x200B;

I look at her, confused.

&amp;#x200B;

"Uhh, yes?"

&amp;#x200B;

She purrs and rubs her face on my shoulder.

&amp;#x200B;

"Show me how it's done", I say.

&amp;#x200B;

She crawls out of bed and opens her closet. 

From there she gets a chain and puts it around her neck. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's on the floor on all fours.

&amp;#x200B;

"Walk me to the kitchen. I'm hungry"

&amp;#x200B;

I get up and hold the leash. She starts crawling out of the room. We walk through the house to the kitchen. There she pushes our cat's food bowl to my feet.

&amp;#x200B;

"Meow"

&amp;#x200B;

I looked like the fucking Rock eyebrow raise meme but I tried to suppress my true emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

I drop the chain and get some cat food. As I fill the bowl she rubs her head again my foot. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I put the bag back I hear crunching from behind.

&amp;#x200B;

I turn and watch in borderline horror as she eats everything I had put in the bowl.

&amp;#x200B;

"Clean my face. Meow."

&amp;#x200B;

I grab a towel and clean her brown face. The smell of the food makes my lunch climb up my throat.

&amp;#x200B;

"Let's play. Meow."

&amp;#x200B;

I walk her to the living room carpet. She rolls onto her back. I pick up one of our cat's toys and hold it above her. She just starts slapping it with her hands.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking at her "play", feeling an emotion I can't describe. Is this her "fetish"?

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately she gets bored after a while and starts rubbing her pussy through her jeans.

&amp;#x200B;

"I need to pee. Meow."

&amp;#x200B;

I walk her to the shower. Above the drain she unzips and starts peeing.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to think anymore. A brief glimpse of her pussy helps me endure the shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I look at her pretty ass in her black jeans. I could be ramming her tight pussy. But no. Here I am, treating her like a cat.

&amp;#x200B;

I was expecting some passionate cat-themed loving. Not this.

&amp;#x200B;

She's done and wants to get into bed. Maybe, just maybe, I could fuck her.



We both roll in and she jumps on top of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

"Pet me. Meow."

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stroke her hair and scratch her jaw. When I move my hands towards more sensitive places she just slaps them. 

&amp;#x200B;

She stops playing and pretends to fall asleep. She's laying on her side back to me. I bust a nut watching her ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get up and drink a beer in the kitchen. She comes there to drink a smoothie. She asks if I had any fun.

I tell her my honest opinion and she starts crying. I feel like a sick shit. She runs into the bedroom and slams the door shut.

&amp;#x200B;

She's ignored me for a whole day. I don't know what to do. I don't want our relationship die because of something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess she just wants to be a cat. Meow.
