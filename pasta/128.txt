Saw this Meta post in r/ChangedFurry and decided to archive it as a copypasta

**Can we PLEASE do something about all of the little kids here? This place is a mess.** 

Okay, this was funny to me a while back, but it's starting to get annoying.

There are so many small children here. Like, under thirteen. Which is right away against the site-wide rules,, you have to be at least thirteen to make an account. And they're just.. being weird, and it's kinda sad, because I don't want them being cringe asf from a young age because they played a Roblox game.

No, you cannot make transfurs real. You are not a scientist, you're a seventh grader. I have a D in biology and I know better than this.

No, you shouldn't be in a fetishy community. You're too young for this. Go do your homework or something.

Yes, changed is about a tf fetish. Grow up.

This sub really feels like it's devolving, half of the posts are either 'is latex changed real?? cen i becom furry??' and 'I wil make latex rel!1! I am a scientist!!'. I know there's not really much the mods can do, so it's more up to the kids themselves. If you're under thirteen, you REALLY shouldn't be here. Please go, you're harming yourself being here.

Okay rant over I'm sorry.
