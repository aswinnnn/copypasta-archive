my child saw the word “bussy” on a video

last night he shoved his butt in the air and said “look at my bussy” and I asked where he heard that word and he said a YouTube video with Spider-Man pushing his bum around and saying it was his bussy. 

I could not find the video but my child is NINE why is this world so cold 🥲 I mean I laughed out of shock tho. I’m watching his videos now and they’re not like that help me.
