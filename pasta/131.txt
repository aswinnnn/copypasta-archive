I (M, 6’7, 250lbs) repeatedly beat the shit out of my baby sister (F, 2’1, Unweighted) because she hit me and I am a leftist. AITA?


Preface: I am a warrior fighting the injustices of modern society (I am a leftist). As you may know, one of the core tenets of leftism is GENDER EQUALITY. This is something that the police will never understand, because they are pursuing me at this moment. POLICE = CONSERVATIVES (this is why they slaughter African Americans). 

Let me clarify my situation. Yesterday afternoon, I was placed with the burden of babysitting my little sister while my parents were at work (it is the winter holidays). Anyways, I tried to change the diaper on that little shit and she was crying her head off at was triggering my mental condition (I have ADHD) so I grabbed both side of the dumbass’s small ass skull, lifted her into the air and screamed into its earlobe “SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!!!” It was at this moment I made my mistake and got assaulted because I let my facial area get within range of her arms. 

She whacked me with her full force and smacked my mouth on the upper lip and left a red mark there. 

It was at this moment my inner leftist spirit grabbed me by the balls and jerked me into activism. 

I’ve read stories on how assaults on men by women get left uncharged, and how men and women have equal rights. I immediately smashed the baby’s skull into my houses concrete wall, and proceeded to stomp on it until the little fucker until it stopped crying. I then swung it by the legs until it generated enough momentum such that it smashed through my tempered glass window and into the backyard. 

It was all over by then. The pit bull got to it and ripped the fucker into 40 million shreds and ate it while vultures circled overhead (I live in California).

I’ll admit my rightful retaliation was a little uncalled for, but the baby, the female, attacked first in this situation. All my actions were in self defence (imo). AITA?
