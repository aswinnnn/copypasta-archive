“Whats a women?” explained by a gamer.

You ever play Portal and look at yourself through 2 portals? That's what a woman is. Sometimes they want to become your "partner" (like duo queuing in Fortnite). Often they want to live with you, kind of like bitch wife.

Sometimes they will want to have sex too. That's like a quick time where you have to keep button spamming till you cross the win threshold and then you get a cutscene like in the GTA strip clubs.

The downside is the shit ton of money you'll spend on cosmetics and loot boxes for her, like microtransactions.

Also, sometimes they'll start queing with another guy or will uninstall the game.
