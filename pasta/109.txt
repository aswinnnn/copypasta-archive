I fucking hate funko pops. (from r/anticonsumption)

Soulless hunks of plastic with no redeeming qualities. This company swallows up creative ips and shits them out as identical little pieces of shit, and people just eat. That. Shit. Up.

And everyone thinks they are the exception too- ‘oh I dont like them, but I have one or two that I got as a gift that I like! They look cool on my shelf!’

No. Fuck off. You’re part of the problem. 

I want to melt them in a cauldron and pour them over peoples heads like that one scene in game of thrones with Daenerys’ creepy brother.

Source: worked in a shop that sold them, I hate every single person that ever bought one. The collectors were the worse but even watching normal people coo over them was just sickening.
