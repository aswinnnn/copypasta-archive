Overwatchâ€™s True Purpose

I jerk off to Overwatch characters based on their play style. I think this is what Blizzard envisioned.

I never actually managed to play the game though, because just the Overwatch logo is enough for me and my dick to go Bastion-mode (this is all I know about the Gorilla character).

Mercy is my favorite because she's angelic and white. Fuck, I wish Overwatch was real. Pornographic Pixar breeding every day. If Mercy was real, she can heal my dick skin, at least what's left of it.

Mercy can gift me healing abilities too. I could go to a graveyard and resurrect all the hot babes from a non-political era. I'll tell them if they don't have sex with me I will make them dead again.
