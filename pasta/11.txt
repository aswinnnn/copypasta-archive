My name is skyler white, yo. [EXTENDED]

Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.

My husband is Walter White, yo.

Uh, huh.

He told me everything.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Seriously?

&amp;#x200B;

\- That's right.

And just so you know...

My brother-in-law is a DEA agent.

And I will not hesitate to call him.

Not if I have to.

Understood?

This is your one

and only warning.

Do not sell marijuana

to my husband.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Okay.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I mean it.

Don't call our house again.

You stay away from him,

or you'll be one sorry individual.

You got me?

&amp;#x200B;

I think so, yeah.

No more marijuana.

I can dig it.

&amp;#x200B;

You can dig it.

Wonderful.

Not that it's any of my business,

but you might wanna consider

a different line of work.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay.
