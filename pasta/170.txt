Chess

So a queen is of course a girl right? At least in
ancient times
and pawns can turn into a queen
so all pawns must be girls too
and pawn can turn into any piece except the king
that means all the pieces beside the king is a girl
so basically, Chess is a harem war between 2
sides, and then you steal each harem member one
by one, like NTR
