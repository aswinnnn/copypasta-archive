A 12 year old online said 'ur gay', how do I tell my parents??? (saw in r/teenagers lmao)

I'm crying rn because I wasn't ready for this information, I always thought I was straight but supposedly I'm gay? I don't really like men, I like women, but is that gay? I'm a guy btw

My parents are gonna kill me if they find out I'm gay now
