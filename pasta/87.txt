I really don't get hookup culture.

I really don't get hookup culture. Like there is no way that sex is that much better than just jerking off. Expecially if you don't even like the person you are doing it with. There is so much more effort to it too. First you gotta swipe on the dumb app for however long that takes and then you gotta chat up the girl enough so that she doesn't think you will murder her then you have to take your car and drive to her place only too fuck for maybe 30 min. Like why? Does anyone actually enjoy this shit? I mean I am a turbo virgin so I wouldn't know but it just seems so shit to me. Is hookup culture just for people with no hobbies or what?
