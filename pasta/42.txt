do not call me a "ðŸ¤“"

No, actually, that is not me. I am not an emoji- nor do I resemble one- I am a human. Also, who are you to tell me what I look like when, in fact, you have never seen me nor likely never will? All that aside, it's clear that you are trying to insult me by calling me a "nerd" (as depicted by the emoji you have sent). I rather take your "insult" as a compliment, as calling me a "nerd", a word often used to mock smarter people, implies that I am more intelligent and have a larger vocabulary than you. Next time you disagree, I recommend you try to come up with an actual argument, or at least prepare yourself one for when necessary. Additionally, before you proceed with sending me a clown emoji (admitting defeat), just understand that you would be further praising me, as a clown is someone who is entertaining and usually considered humorous by the spectators. Furthermore, you would also be implying that I, employed by a business to perform as a clown, have a profession. So, not only are you implying that I am smart, you are also implying that I am funny and have a job, which, judging by; your lack of proper arguments your usage of childish and overused internet humor the amount of spare time you have to brainwash yourself 12 hours per day with social media culture; you are neither intelligent, comedic, or employed. Enjoy allowing yourself to continue on through life as such, as I believe with full confidence that you lack the decency to better your ruined self for the real world. Carry on and have a pleasant day.
