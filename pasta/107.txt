Some Yanderedev rant but itâ€™s yandereDick


Is it I, YandereDick. I have an important announcement to make. Yes, development began 6 years ago. But my sperm is much more ambitious and complex than an average cum. The premise itself may seem straightforward, but the number of sperms and volume of my cum is comparable to that of a cum lord. It's unrealistic to expect cum like this to reach the optimization stage in less than 6 years, simply due to the unusually large volume and sperm count of the cum, coupled with the fact that it's mostly being developed by a single testicle. Nobody can accurately estimate how long it should take to reach the egg, because there isn't a pre-existing ejaculation that my cum can be compared to.
