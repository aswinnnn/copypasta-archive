Little Japanese Girl: A Short Story

You are a 9 year-old Japanese girl. You do normal kid stuff, like watch cartoons. You always see America present in most media's that you watch. After months of convincing and  pestering your parents, they accept to take you on a vacation to the USA. You arrive there. For a few days, you have the time of your life, but, on the last day there, you pass by something called Lolicon. 

You peek inside, as you saw a poster earlier advertising that one of your favourite cartoons will have a stand here. You expect to see other like-minded children of the same age as you. However, you are taken aback by the lack of kids there, seeing only deformed balls of fat that can only technically be considered human, which you approximate to be around 30-years old. Suddently, one of these shapes turns around its head, or at least you assume it is, for it has no neck. It yells at the top of its lungs, which are hidden under 40 layers of fat, "OMG an actual, real life loli!". The rest of the blobs all turn simultaneously towards you, lunging at you. 

 You start to run. The things aren't very fast, thank god,  but you are slowly getting out of breath. While running away, you hear them screeching nonsense about how you should be their subservient waifu/slave, because they know how to treat wahmen. You see a patch of grass in the distance, and with your remaining energy, you sprint towards it at full speed, the heaps crushing everything in their paths. You land on the grass and pass out. Several hours later, the mounds are still there, but they cannot approach you. You see one of them try, but as soon as it touched the grass, it dissolved. You are safe, but cannot remain there forever, and you just hope your parents are still alive and will find you soon.
