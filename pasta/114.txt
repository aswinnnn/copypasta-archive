AITA for enabling my son?

My son [12M] is a little playboy. I got calls from his school and several angry parents complaining that he had sex with some classmates. It was consensual. 

As soon as I heard this news I went up to his bedroom, gave him a firm bear hug and said “I’m proud of you son, you’re an absolute legend.” My wife is filing for divorce now because she said I should have gotten angry with him and punished him. AITA?
