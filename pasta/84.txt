Shut the fuck up

Hey Squidward, shut the fuck up. I don't know what your problem is, man. I have 30 minutes for lunch, and I'm spending them here, alright? There's no one behind me in line, so what if I took an extra ten seconds to order? Who cares, man? You really are something else, you know that? You lash out at people, and why? Because you hate your job? News flash, asshole, everyone hates their job. I work at the grocery store, I have to deal with bullshit all the time too. But I don't act like a sarcastic prick with customers. You know Squidward, this town does not like you, and it's not because you're some misunderstood artist, or genius, or we just don't 'get you', it's because you're mean, alright? Look at Spongebob, he works in front of a hot grill all day, but we like him, and you know why? Because he's nice. He says hello to us. Look man I don't want to be this type of customer you know, I don't like to start fights with folks, but like, you can't do that, alright? And I'm not gonna call out Mr Krabs or anything, I just want to get my food and go. Please learn from this. Alright?... Thank you...
