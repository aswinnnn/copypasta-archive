Homelander’s speech from the end of S3 E2

I don't make mistakes, I'm not like the rest of you. I'm stronger, I'm smarter, I'm better. I AM BETTER. I'm not some weak kneed fucking crybaby that goes around fucking apologising all the time and why the fuck would you want me to be? All my life people have tried to control me, my whole life. Rich people, powerful people, tried to muzzle me, cancel me, keep me impotent and obedient like I'm a fucking puppet. And you know what it worked, Because I allowed it to work and guess what, if they can control me then you can bet your ass they can control you. They already do you just don’t realize it. I’m done. I am done apologising, I am done being persecuted for my strength. You people should be thanking christ that I am who I am, because you need me. You need me to save you, you do. I am the only one who possibly can. You're not the real heroes, I’m the real hero. I’m the real hero.
