My mom still "breastfeeds" me everyday. I'm 19. I'm 19 years old and my mom still breastfeeds me everyday.

I'm 19 years old and my mom still breastfeeds me everyday. She doesn't really have milk or anything anymore, but everyday around 8pm, we snuggle and I suckle for 1-2 hours before she goes to bed. It's always been this way, and I see nothing weird about it. I know it's supposed to be some weird thing so I can't talk about in public.

It is a beautiful feeling and a beautiful experience. It doesn't get overly sexual, it's just two humans bonding and I wish society was more accepting of these types of things.
