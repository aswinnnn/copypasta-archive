AITA for shooting my little brother in the face with a 12 gauge shotgun?

My little brother (7) was sitting on his Xbox playing Fortnite when all of a sudden he screamed the hard r n word twelve times and didn't have a pass, so I (15m) went into my alcoholic stepdad's (56) room while he was sleeping on the couch and grabbed his shotgun from the unlocked gun safe and shot my little brother in the face. I need answers fast because I'm going to court tomorrow and they'll definitely listen to people on the internet

edit: the judge said I'm not guilty but I'm going to a foster home because my stepdad shattered the bones in my legs and I am now paralyzed me from the waist down ðŸ˜”

edit 2: I still have the shotgun for self defense, and I have been placed in my new home, there are no kids but there's a 50 year old fat guy with a 27 year old woman as my new parents, I hope to post a new update soon

edit 3: IDGAF IF I'M THE ASSHOLE ANYMORE THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED
