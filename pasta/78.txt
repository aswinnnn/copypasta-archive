My mother in law drank my ball juice and my (now) wife doesn’t know

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago i saw a tiktok video about how if you dip you balls into pineapple juice you can taste it. This peaked my interest because we always had a carton of pineapple juice in the fridge due to my girlfriend’s pregnancy cravings.

I did googling and it was supposedly true and it said that we have “ taste buds” in our balls.”It cant be true” i thought to myself, thinking it was another thing that’s dangerous for you to be trending at the time .And 2021 me was desperate for any clout even if that meant harming myself doing so in fact if i did this i would probably get more fame from it.No pain no game.

I ran straight down stairs and to the fridge and poured the juice. As nobody was at home at the time.I learned the answer squatting in the middle of the kitchen, pineapple in hand .

I heard the key to the door rattle, i quickly scrambled to pull my trousers up and help with the shopping,leaving the glass on the counter. My mother in law rushes past me sweating in the heatwave. I carry the shopping into the babies room.I walk into the kitchen humming a song that had been stuck in my head at the time,my heart drops.

There stood my mother in law drinking my ball infused pineapple juice.They both looked up confused to my sudden silence. I just forced a smile and went to help cook dinner horrified .They still don’t know to this day,I don’t know how to tell them. Should i confess?
