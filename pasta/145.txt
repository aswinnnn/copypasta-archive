my girlfriend impersonates hatsune miku everytime we have sex, what should i do?

like i said, my girlfriend wont stop using a miku voice during sex. the entire time, for every noise she makes. its a really great impression, dont get me wrong, but theres a time and a place. at first, it was a little funny, but she keeps on doing it. every. time. i love her a lot, and our relationship is perfect otherwise, so i really dont want to have to break up with her over this, but its getting so bad that ive contemplated it.

has anyone experienced something similar? what should i do about it?
