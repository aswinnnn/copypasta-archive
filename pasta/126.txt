Hey OP please stop replying to your own post

Hey OP please stop replying to your own post. It’s seen by karma farming by most of experienced Redditors and we definitely won’t hesitate to down-vote your comments. Don’t you think the karma points you’ve gained from the post itself are enough? There’s no need to extend your metaphorical limb down the karma jar and pick up as much karma points as you can by clugging-up the whole comment section with your replies. I’ll give you 10 minutes to delete the comments. When I come back I will down-vote them if they have not been removed.

Edit: Guys, you are down-voting the wrong person.
