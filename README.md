## copypasta-archive

---

### created for the preservation of information historically, aesthetically or culturally significant.

Just something i created to learn how github actions work tbh. Feel free to do anything at all.

#### changes : 
+ `[November 6, 2022]` date system for the file names have been abolished due to copypastas being timeless. (the file metadata would do just fine if you want the dates for some reason)
+ `[November 6, 2022]` the new file name system makes it easy to introduce an API to interact with the copypastas.
